                <p>Please note that due to individual monitor settings, lighting, and perception of colors, the actual product color may differ slightly from what appears on your screen. Complaints based solely on color differences caused by display variations will not be considered valid.</p>

                <p>The right to a warranty or return is void if the product has been modified or altered by the customer or a third party not authorized by FurniStyle.</p>

                <p>Returns and complaints must be submitted within the legal timeframes defined by the consumer protection laws in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>

                <h3>Can I return a damaged or unsatisfactory item?</h3>
                <p>Yes. If your furniture item arrives damaged or does not meet your expectations, you are entitled to return it or file a complaint. Simply email us with the subject line <strong>“Order Return”</strong> or <strong>“Order Complaint”</strong> and include your order number.</p>

                <p>The item must be returned within the agreed-upon time frame. The return will be accepted if the item meets legal return or complaint requirements according to the Law on Obligations and the Consumer Protection Act in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
